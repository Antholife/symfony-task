For start the project, you need to have installed the following tools:
- Node.js
- npm
- Symfony

After that, you can clone the project and run the following commands:

```composer install```

```symfony serve```

The project is still improvable, but that's not the objective of this assignment which focuses on testing. Indeed, later on, I could create a relationship between tasks and users, for example (currently all users share the same tasks), implement account deletion, task sharing among users, messaging between users, or further improve the task model, account management, an administrator interface, etc.
